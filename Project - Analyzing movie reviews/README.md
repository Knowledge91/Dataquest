# Project - Analyzing Movie Reviews

Once again we analyze Movie Revies by:
- RottenTomatoes
- IMDB
- Metascore
- Fandango

Aim will be to describe Fandangos higher scoring. Fandango is earning money from movie makers directly, which could influence its rating (in a positive way).

What we used in this Jupyter Notebook is:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy (pearsonr, and linreg)

with the following statistical methods:
- mean
- median
- standard deviation
- pearsonr
- linear regression
- histogram
- scatter plots
